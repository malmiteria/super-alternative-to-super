Motivation :
the super builtin works in misterious ways, this projects attempts at crafting a better solution.

The problems :
 - In case of multiple inheritance, super would not always point to the direct parent
 - the MRO (method resolution order) algorithm, doesn't match the zen of python's guidelines, mainly :
   - errors shouldn't pass silently
   - explicit is better than implicit


A little explanation

# What is MRO:

Inheritance implies that a child class would inherit parent methods. For example
```
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
class A(B):
    pass

A().method() # prints B
```

In case of multiple inheritance, such as : 
```
class C:
    def method(self):
        print('C')
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
class A(B,C):
    pass
```
It is unclear what ```A().method()``` should print.

Or in other term, there is a conflict between the parents method when a child instance tries to inherit a method that both parent seem to have.

The MRO algorithm comes as a solution to this problem, by linearising the inheritance trees, which in term allows to resolve the method of instance A as the method of the first parent in MRO order capable to deliver this method.

This linearisation comes with a few meaningful rules, such as:
 - child < parent
 - parent_to_the_left < parent_to_the_right
 - no duplicates

I do not know if there are more rules into MRO.

This also means that some inheritance trees are not allowed, such as:
```
class X:
    pass
class Y:
    pass
class A(X,Y): # X < Y
    pass
class B(Y,X): # Y < X
    pass
class Problem(A,B): # X < Y AND Y < X, can't resolve MRO, raise a TypeError and refuses to create the class
    pass
```

In python, MRO is used to resolve attributes too.

If you are curious to know what the mro of a class is, just print ```<the_class_you're_curious_about>.__mro__```

# What is super

super is a builtin method that acts as a proxy that can be used when a child class wants to access it's parent class context.

The most common use is in case of inheritance, when the child class extends a parent method:
```
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
class A(B):
    def method(self):
        print('A')
        super().method()

A().method() # prints A then prints B
```


In case of multiple inheritance, super visits the next class in line:
```
class C:
    def method(self):
        print('C')
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
class A(B,C):
    def method(self):
        print('A')
        super().method()

A().method() # prints A then prints B (and never prints C)
```


in this exemple, if you want `A().method()` to print A B C using `super`, you have two options, both are not reliable:
option 1, which is consistent with the argumentless syntax of `super`, but make it impossible to use B().method() as it now would raise an error.:
```
class C:
    def method(self):
        print('C')
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
        super().method() # HERE
class A(B,C):
    def method(self):
        print('A')
        super().method()
```
option 2, which would still allow `B().method()` to run properly, but some inheritance trees including A could fail:
```
class C:
    def method(self):
        print('C')
class B:
    def method(self):
        print('B')
class A(B,C):
    def method(self):
        print('A')
        super().method()
        super(B, self).method() # HERE
class D(B):
    def method(self):
        print('D')
class E(A,D):
    def method(self):
        print('E')
        super().method()
        super(A, self).method()

E().method() # prints E A D C D (despite E.__mro__ presenting no duplicates, and A B C order is lost)
```

# The flaws

The mro as it stands is flawed in five ways in my opinion:
 - the order in which parents of a class A are visited isn't reliable, and can be altered by A's childs, despite the fact that A's definition doesn't involve A's child at all. It is not possible to garantee any mro will be preserved in any context.
 - The mro hides what really should be an error by trying to solve it, and refuses developper the opportunity to solve it case by case, when it would emerge
 - the mro can't solve the problem it pretends to in all context, and then assumes the error to be too critical to allow developpers to plug in their solutions. (mro failure leads to class definition being not allowed)
 - it doesn't allows for duplicates, assuming that no one would want that.
 - it assumes it is possible / meaningful to 'order' an inheritance tree, when such a thing is definitely not a given.

`super()` as it stands is flawed in two ways in my opinion:
 - it relies on mro, so it brings in all mro flaws with it
 - it adds a level of indirection by giving the context of the next in mro line instead of the context of the class passed as argument : ```super(A, self)``` is a proxy to the parent of A, not of A.
 - it doesn't explicitely tell what parent it will access, which can be confusing in case of multiple inheritance


# The good parts

The mro is a solution to a possible conflict between multiple parents methods. As much as i would prefer the error to not be silenced, a solution should still be provided.
It works very well for simple cases, and any other solutions should probably do as well on those simple cases.


`super()` acts as a proxy to the class it points to, meaning we don't have to pass the instance as first argument of any method accessed through super.
super is very easy to use in general, and the simple cases work as expected.

It could also be argued that the actual behavior of super could be useful in some cases, as a good understanding of its behavior really allows good control over someone else's classes.
I would personally argue that such a feature is not related to the core feature of super, could also be considered a flaw as lib maker might wanna lock their classes inheritance trees, and as such, won't be considered something to keep in the solution I'm building.



# What would be an ideal solution
## Explicit Method Resolution:
  I think it can be boiled down to those features :
  - *straightforward case* : when a class "A" has a method "method", no matter if A has any parents, A().method should resolve to the method "method" of class "A"
  - *can't be found* : when a class A *doesn't* have a method "method", and *all* it's parent raise a "MethodDoesNotExist" error, A().method should raise a "MethodDoesNotExist" error.
  - *only one parent has it* : when a class "A" *doesn't* have a method "method", inherits from class "B" which can resolve a method "method", and also inherits from 0 to n other classes, *all* of which raising a "MethodDoesNotExist" error when looking for the method "method", A().method should resolve to the method "method" of class "B"
  - *multiple parents have it* : when a class "A" *doesn't* have a method "method", and inherits from multiple parent, at least two of which can resolve a method "method", A().method should raise a ConcurentMethodResolutionError, stating that explicit inheritance order is required
  - *transmitting errors* : when a class "A" *doesn't* have a method "method", if any parent raises a ConcurentMethodResolutionError, A().method should raise a ConcurentMethodResolutionError

  a possible extra feature would be :
  - *multiple parent have it, but from the same source (ie. diamond shape inheritance)* : when a class "A" *doesn't* have a method "method", and inherits from multiple parent, at least two of which can resolve a method "method", *and* all of the parent resolving the method "method" from the same, unique grandparent "G", A().method should resolve to the method "method" of the grandparent class "G"

## Super alternative to super
  - *reliability* : should always target the same parent class it is defined to target, no matter what inheritance tree it is a part of.
  - *expliciteness* : in case there is multiple parent classes, should explicitely define which one it targets
  - *impliciteness* : can be implicit when there's only one parent
  - *ancestors only* : can only target ancestors, meaning it can't target itself, and can target any parents, and any of their parents, recursively, allowing for direct access to grandparents, grand grand parents, and so on.
